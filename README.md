Welcome to the "Awesome Claude Prompts" repository! This is a collection of prompt examples to be used with the Claude model.

The [Claude](https://claude.ai/) model is an AI assistant created by [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com/) that is capable of generating human-like text. By providing it with a prompt, it can generate responses that continue the conversation or expand on the given prompt. 

[Claude](https://claude.ai/) offers many amazing features that [ChatGPT](https://ai.com) does not support, such as longer contexts (up to 100k), free file uploading, etc., making it more powerful than ChatGPT. 

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with Claude. We encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/yzfly/awesome-claude-prompts/edit/main/README.md) to the list, and to use Claude to generate new prompts as well.

To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for Claude. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.

We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun using Claude!

## Summarize this PDF document (official example)

upload your PDF document then use the following prompt:
```
Summarize this PDF document in a bullet point outline. Make a markdown table of study questions and answers.
```

## Explain Python Code (official example)

upload your python file then use the following prompt:

```

```

## Practice Spanish Vocab (official example)

```
Help me practice my Spanish vocab.

For every turn, message me with a single Spanish word that I should translate to English.

Start with a very easy word. If I get it right, make the next word more difficult. If I get it wrong, explain what the correct answer was, and reduce difficulty for the next turn.

You can include emoji hints to help me.
